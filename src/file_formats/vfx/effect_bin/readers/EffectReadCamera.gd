## CAMERA-TIMELINE reader for `E###.BIN` (#1329) — GDScript port of
## `parse_effect.parse_camera_keyframes` + `parse_camera_phase_table`, the read mirror of
## `writers/EffectWriteCamera.gd`.
## Vault: [[Effect File Format]]
##
## Three FIXED-SLOT SoA tables — `phase1` (21 slots), `for_each` (17), `phase2` (21) — each
## holding parallel arrays of `end_frame`, a 3×s16 angle, a 3×s16 position, a 3×s16 zoom and a
## u16 command word, plus one `max_keyframe` watermark.
##
## 🔴 ALL THREE BASE AT `timeline_section_ptr` DIRECTLY — NOT `+8`. The screen and palette
## `for_each` channels DO take the `+8` bias, and the camera's `for_each` table does not. That
## is the single easiest thing to get wrong in this corner of the file, and the tables are
## adjacent enough that an eight-byte slip still decodes into plausible-looking numbers.
##
## THE TABLE IS ALWAYS `count` SLOTS LONG, WATERMARK OR NOT. `max_keyframe` says how many the
## engine walks; the parser returns every native slot regardless, so the keyframes past the
## watermark are real bytes and round-trip. That is also why `EffectWriteCamera` can refuse an
## over-capacity table instead of growing one: there is no slot to grow into.
##
## ⚠️ THE READER CLAMPS WHERE THE WRITER REFUSES. A `max_keyframe` outside `[0, count)` reads
## as 0 here (mirroring the Python), while `EffectWriteCamera.serialize_table` returns a refusal
## for the same value. Both are right for their direction — a reader must produce something for
## bytes that exist, a writer must not stamp a watermark the ROM cannot hold — but it means
## referee B would go quiet on a corpus effect with a bad watermark, because the clamped 0 is
## what gets written back. Measured: no corpus effect has one (seeding the clamp away is green).
##
## ABSENT IS `null`, and a table that would read past EOF is OMITTED rather than zero-filled —
## so `camera.json` can carry one, two or three tables and the key set itself is data.
##
## 🔴 THREE DEFENSIVE PATHS HERE ARE UNGUARDED — each seeded, RUN, and green across all 400:
## the `max_keyframe` clamp, `_vec3`'s out-of-bounds `[0, 0, 0]`, and `_s16_or_zero`'s fallback.
## No corpus effect has a watermark outside its slots or a table that runs off the end of the
## file, so none of the three is exercised. They are ported because the Python has them and a
## reader that crashed on a malformed file would be worse — not because anything checks them.
##
## No `class_name` (ADR-0004) — file_model members stay path-preloaded.

## `cmd & 0x01E0` -> the keyframe's source mode. Sparse — 0x0A0, 0x0E0, 0x120, 0x160, 0x1A0 have

## `cmd & 0x1E00` -> the interpolation. Also sparse, and note 0x0000 is NOT in it: a command
